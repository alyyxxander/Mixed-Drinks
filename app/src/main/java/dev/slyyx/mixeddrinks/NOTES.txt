Q: Can you use the same android:id in different activities?
A: Yes, you can. You can do this because whenever you use findViewById() to get a
    reference to a part of your layout, the method only looks for that view in the currently
    inflated layout. So even if you have another view with the same ID in another layout, Android will not look for it there.

    element.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); //keeps the visibility to on
    element.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE); //hides the element but preserves the space take up by it
    element.setVisibility(View.GONE); //completely hides the element from layout file
